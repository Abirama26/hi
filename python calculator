# This is a simple python program for the calculator 
# Determing Two variables 
# Soit can take two variables from the user the two variables are x and y

x=float(input("Enter the first number = "))
y=float(input("Enter the second number = "))

# The below command are used to give the user an insight about what are all the
# operation available to perform 
# Variable n is used to collect the data of operation that is to be performed 


print('The available operations are ')
print('1.Addition')
print('2.Subtraction ')
print('3.Multiplication ')
print('4.Division')
n=int(input("Enter the desired operation to be perfomed = "))

# Determing upon the value of n the operarttion that is to be performed is calculated 

if(n==1):
  f=x+y
  print('The addition of two numbers =',f)
elif(n==2):
  f=x-y
  print('The subtraction of two numbers =',f)
elif(n==3):
  f=x*y
  print('The multiplication of two numbers =',f)
elif(n==4):
  f=x/y
  print('The divison of two numbers =',f)
else:
  print("Invalid operation")

# The output is stored in variable f which prints the desired result at the output screen 
# This program runned and verified in google collab notes
